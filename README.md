BGP Daemon in Node.js
=====================

simple implementation of the bgp protocol stack - set your ip address and your AS and it'll publish a
number of prefixes (can be changed part way down the code - up to about a million prefixes works without
much drama)


Has a little cli where you can control route publication, type "h" or "?" to get help in the cli
